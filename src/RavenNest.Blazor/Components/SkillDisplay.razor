@*  Not sure how to get around the CSS Isolation, ideally this be better in the calling parent but since this is a component, it's isolated from parent
    The idea of this component is to create a consisent Skill Name to Skill Icon look across the website, and let the parent style as needed but that doesn't seem to happen *flip-table**@

<div class="skill-display">
    <span class="skill-name">@SkillName</span>
    <span class="skill-icon">

        <span class="@SkillStyled.SkillImgStylingClass" title="@SkillName">
            @if (SkillStyled.SkillImgLocation != null)
            {
                <img class="@SkillStyled.SkillImgStylingClass" src="@SkillStyled.SkillImgSource" alt="@SkillName Icon" />
            }
        </span>
    </span>
</div>
